        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            The best beef and noodles you'll ever have! Affordable, quick, and
            yummy. I have to give credit to my grandma. She used to cook this
            for her 5 kids and then later for all her grandkids.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound sirloin steak, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup beef stock</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 pinch dried thyme</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>4 cups egg noodles</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat a skillet over medium-high heat; cook steak, working in
                batches, until seared and browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.
                Transfer seared steak to a plate.
            </li>
            <li>
                Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat and saut√© onion
                until softened, 5 to 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add steak to onion in the skillet; pour in beef stock and season
                with bay leaves, thyme, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil;
                reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until steak is tender,
                about 50 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir peas and cornstarch into steak mixture; cook uncovered
                until liquid thickens, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
                Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally
                until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 5 minutes;
                drain.
            </li>
            <li>Serve beef mixture over noodles.</li>
        </ol>
